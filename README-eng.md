Mjolnir Launcher is a Minecraft launcher that works with the Manage Server plugin

## Supported Platforms

``Windows & macOS``

## Do I need to pay any fees?

Our Mjolnir Launcher is FREE!

As long as your Microsoft account has a genuine Minecraft license.

## Why is Mojang account login not supported?

When the Mjolnir team studied Mojang account login, they found that the account is more dangerous at the login stage than the Microsoft account login (it is recommended that old players who have not transferred to Microsoft should transfer quickly to avoid being stolen by Lupin III)

Tips! Mojang has announcements [Mojang News](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/last-call-voluntarily-migrate-java-accounts)
